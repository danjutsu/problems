///reading it, i knew I'd need to create a CTE "A WITH" but I like to define what needs to wrapped in the with before bundling it.
///so the first draft goes: 
SELECT 
campaign_id AS Campaign_ID, 
campaign_name AS Campaign_Name,
ROUND((revenue_generated - investment) / investment * 100) AS ROI
FROM marketing_spend
ORDER by ROI DESC

///then looked again and saw i needed to change
ORDER by ROI, Campaign_ID DESC

///I have my main output. now I need to filter it to the top 25%. there's a few ways to do this. I wanted to use the WITH so i do it manually. I think I need to RANK the the output, but I'm already using order by, so I will assign the output to ROW_NUMBERs. I wrap the data in a WITH and add row numbers
WITH datapoints AS (
  SELECT 
  campaign_id AS Campaign_ID, 
  campaign_name AS Campaign_Name,
  ROUND((revenue_generated - investment) / investment * 100) AS ROI, 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER by (revenue_generated - investment) / investment) AS RowNumber 
  )      
-- my way is TRY TEST TRANSFORM. so i remove the WITH and run my code to see the output. my rows count up 1, 2, 3... but I need the TOP 25% so 
WITH datapoints AS (
  SELECT 
  campaign_id AS Campaign_ID, 
  campaign_name AS Campaign_Name,
  ROUND((revenue_generated - investment) / investment * 100) AS ROI, 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER by (revenue_generated - investment) / investment) DESC, campaign_id DESC AS RowNumber 
  COUNT(*) OVER () AS TotalCampaigns
  FROM marketing_spend  
  )
  SELECT
Campaign_ID,
Campaign_Name,
ROI
FROM datapoints
WHERE RowNumber <= COUNT(Campaign_ID * 0.25)

/// it throws an error WITH datapoints AS (SELECT campaign_id AS Campaign_ID, campaign_name AS Campaign_Name, ROUND((revenue_generated - investment) / investment * 100) AS ROI, ROW_NUMBER() OVER ROI AS RowNumber, COUNT(*) OVER () AS TotalCampaigns FROM "marketing_spend") SELECT Campaign_ID, Campaign_Name, ROI FROM datapoints WHERE RowNumber <= COUNT(TotalCampaigns * 0.25) ORDER BY ROI DESC, Campaign_ID DESC - window "roi" does not exist///
/// had to research but I see. Can't use COUNT in the WHERE and I forgot the ) after DESC

///final solution:

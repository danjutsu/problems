Marketing Spend

John created a new Social Media App and has just started advertising it to the world! He collected some data, but wants to see which marketing campaigns performed the best.

Write a query to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) for each campaign and identify the top 25% of campaigns that have the highest ROI. The ROI is calculated as ((Revenue Generated - Investment) / Investment * 100). Round ROI to the nearest whole number.

The output should have the columns Campaign_ID, Campaign_Name, and ROI, and should be ordered by ROI in descending order and Campaign_ID in descending order. Only include the top 25% of campaigns with the highest ROI.
